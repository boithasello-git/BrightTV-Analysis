# BrightTV-Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing BrightTV viewership data to understand audience behavior, engagement levels, and content performance. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover meaningful insights about:

Viewing patterns across time

Popular content and programs

Device and platform preferences

Regional and demographic trends

The dataset (BrightTV_Viewership.csv) contains records of viewing activity and will serve as the foundation for analysis.
